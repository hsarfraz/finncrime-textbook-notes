| Dimension | Key Question | P&L Impact | How to Pull It (Levers) | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
| S – Scale  | Is volume growing vs. market, internal benchmarks, and long-term aspiration? | Net Sales, Gross Margin 
(abs), EBITDA | Drive distribution, build awareness, accelerate 
penetration |  
| T– Target  | Are we buying growth through schemes/GTN and field-force cost, or earning it?  | Volume, Net Margin  | Scheme discipline, incentive redesign, call plan, focus brands | 
| R– Reform | What are our total costs? What costs are structural vs fixable without harming prescriptions?  | COGS, Gross Margin, EBITDA  | SKU simplification, reduce slow movers/expiry leakage, manufacturing/pack optimisation, overhead 
hygiene  | 
| I – Improve | What’s our GM or cost-to-serve by SKU/channel/geography? Where are margins leaking by SKU/channel/region (cost-to-serve + returns)? | Net Sales, GM %, Net Margin | Prune tail, route-to-market discipline, better mix, tighten credit/returns  |  
| P– Price  | Do we have pricing headroom without losing Rx, and are we managing GTN net-realisation? | Revenue/unit, GM %, Volume | Price ladder discipline, pack rationalisation, targeted price moves, GTN governance |
