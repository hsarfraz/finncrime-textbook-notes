 > The police had noticed that these burglars were very well-equipped. They had bugging equipment and a walkie-talkie, and four were discovered to be in possession of substantial amounts of currency. Eugenio Martinez had $814 in his pockets, $700 of which was in $100 bills with sequential serial numbers. Frank Sturgis had $215, and Virgilio Gonzalez and Bernard Barker each had $230. Most of this money was also in $100 bills in sequence, and more money was found downstairs. Altogether, police recovered $4,500 of the crisp, new hundreds money the burglars had apparently brought with them to the scene of the crime.
