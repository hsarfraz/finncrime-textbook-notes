> The police had noticed that these burglars were very well-equipped. They had bugging equipment and a walkie-talkie, and four were discovered to be in possession of substantial amounts of currency. Eugenio Martinez had $814 in his pockets, $700 of which was in $100 bills with sequential serial numbers. Frank Sturgis had $215, and Virgilio Gonzalez and Bernard Barker each had $230. Most of this money was also in $100 bills in sequence, and more money was found downstairs. Altogether, police recovered $4,500 of the crisp, new hundreds-- money the burglars had apparently brought with them to the scene of the crime.

Could the $100 bill splits be an example of smurfing?
* smurfing/structuring is when large sums of money are broken down into **smaller deposits (or withdrawals)** under reporting thresholds (e.g., under $10,000 in the U.S.) to avoid triggering a CTR.

Do all types of money have a sequential serial number?
* yes, all bank notes have sequntial numbers

What is the purpose of a sequential serical number in a bank note?
* It can help trace back funds to a single withdrawal source (like a campaign fund)

Is the situation of the robbers having money an example of placement?
* No, the “placement” occurred earlier, when the illegal campaign money (e.g., donations or slush funds) was first moved into legitimate bank accounts which allowed the robbers to withdraw the money. The robbers were going to make the money "clean" again by spending it which makes it closer to integration, not layering, because the money was already laundered and was now being applied in the real world.
