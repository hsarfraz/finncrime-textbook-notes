> The police had noticed that these burglars were very well-equipped. They had bugging equipment and a walkie-talkie, and four were discovered to be in possession of substantial amounts of currency. Eugenio Martinez had $814 in his pockets, $700 of which was in $100 bills with sequential serial numbers. Frank Sturgis had $215, and Virgilio Gonzalez and Bernard Barker each had $230. Most of this money was also in $100 bills in sequence, and more money was found downstairs. Altogether, police recovered $4,500 of the crisp, new hundreds-- money the burglars had apparently brought with them to the scene of the crime.

Could the $100 bill splits be an example of smurfing?
* smurfing/structuring is when large sums of money are broken down into **smaller deposits (or withdrawals)** under reporting thresholds (e.g., under $10,000 in the U.S.) to avoid triggering a CTR.

Do all types of money have a sequential serial number?
* yes, all bank notes have sequntial numbers

What is the purpose of a sequential serical number in a bank note?
* It can help trace back funds to a single withdrawal source. But only stacks of bills can be traced since all the bills in the stack would have sequential serial numbers

Is the situation of the robbers having money an example of placement?
* No, the “placement” occurred earlier, when the illegal campaign money (e.g., donations or slush funds) was first moved into legitimate bank accounts which allowed the robbers to withdraw the money. The robbers were going to make the money "clean" again by spending it which makes it closer to integration, not layering, because the money was already laundered and was now being applied in the real world.

> Investigators immediately began trying to trace these funds needed by the fact that, in 1972, all American banks were recording the serial numbers of $100 bills given out to customers. They followed the money trail to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, to its Miami, Florida branch. And from there to the Republic National Bank, Miami, which coincidentally was the hometown of four of the five burglars.

> In Miami, investigators learned that the bills had been given to Bernard Barker, one of the men they arrested. Barker had taken this money in a series of cash withdrawals from the trust account of his company, Barker & Associates, Inc., a real estate firm. Barker had made three cash withdrawals totaling $114,000 from this account, $25,000 on April 24, $33,000 on May 2, and $56,000 on May 8, 1972.

To clarify, what investors did here was **currency tracing** or **serial number tracing**. In AML lingo, it would fall under following the money trail (a forensic accounting technique), not a laundering tactic.

Barker & Associates looked like a real estate firm but functioned as a **front company** (slightly different from a pure “shell” — a shell has no real operations, a front has some but is used to launder money). In this case, it was used to receive illegal campaign funds → this is the layering stage, since the money had already been placed into the financial system before being routed there.

The burgulars **were not** money mules since a money mule is usually an unwitting or semi-witting person who transfers money on behalf of criminals (often in cybercrime, online banking, romance scams, etc.). Here, the burglars were **co-conspirators**, knowingly moving and spending the cash. More accurate terms would be couriers or agents rather than mules.

<ins> Money Laundering Stages </ins>

Placement: The campaign funds (illegal donations) first entered the banking system.

Layering: Funds were moved into Barker’s company account → then withdrawn in cash bundles. This made it harder to directly tie the money to the campaign.

Integration (what burglars wanted to do): Use that cash for political espionage activity (paying for operations, equipment, bribes, etc.) to “reinsert” it into the economy disguised as legitimate expenses.

> Investigators now went the other direction along the money trail, trying to find the source of the $114,000. They discovered that on April 20th, Barker had made a deposit of exactly $114,000, consisting of four bank drafts and one cashier's check. Did the bank have more information about the deposited items? Yes. The four bank drafts in amounts of $15,000, $18,000, $24,000, and $32,000 had been drawn on a Mexican bank. The Banco Internacional of Mexico City, the name of a Mexico City attorney, Manuel Orgario de Aguirre, appeared on the drafts.

> The cashier's check for the remaining $25,000 had been purchased with cash by Kenny Dahlberg from First Bank and Trust Company of Boca Raton, Florida. Investigators turned first to this check for additional leads, learning that Mr. Dahlberg was a Minnesota businessman who maintained a home in Boca Raton. When contacted, Dahlberg acknowledged buying the cashier's check on April 8, 1972 with $25,000 in cash he had received that day on a local golf course from Dwayne Andreas. Investigators now wanted to know why Andreas had given Dahlberg the money and how it had gotten from Dahlberg to Barker.
